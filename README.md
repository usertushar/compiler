Q. Why you want to build a compiler?

Building a compiler as a project can be a challenging and rewarding endeavor for various reasons. Here are some reasons why someone might want to build a compiler as a project:
•	Compiler construction involves a deep understanding of programming languages, parsing techniques, code generation, and optimization algorithms. It provides a valuable learning experience for those interested in computer science and software engineering.
•	Developing a compiler involves solving complex problems related to parsing, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation. These challenges can be intellectually stimulating and satisfying to overcome.
•	Building a compiler allows you to explore the design and implementation of programming languages. You can experiment with language features, syntax, and semantics to create a language tailored to specific needs or interests.

Q. Which language you want to build this compiler?

I want to build this compiler in C language. C provides a high degree of low-level control over the hardware and memory, making it suitable for implementing various aspects of a compiler, including memory management, data structures, and machine code generation. C is known for its efficiency in terms of both runtime performance and memory usage. Compilers, as critical software tools, benefit from this efficiency, as they need to generate optimized machine code efficiently.

Q. Why is my compiler different from other compilers?

Consider factors such as performance, code optimization, portability, error detection, or language support. 
•	If my compiler generates code that runs faster or consumes less memory than other compilers for a specific set of benchmarks or real-world applications, present performance data to support my claim. 
•	If my compiler produces code that is more portable and can be easily adapted to different platforms, demonstrate this by showing how my compiler handles cross-compilation or generates code for a broader range of architectures.
